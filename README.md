### Dataset 💾
The dataset should be contained in the folder ```data``` (available in https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/4000 ). The code expects the data to be put in the data folder

The top level are the attitude roots:

├── Asp_clarity
├── Asp_meaningful-comparison
├── Asp_motivation-impact
├── Asp_originality
├── Asp_replicability
├── Asp_substance
```

The attitude roots are categorized into the following folders: 
``` 
├── actions (rebuttal actions such as rebuttal_answer, etc.)  
├── rebuttal (the rebuttal sentences for the particular attitude theme)
├── review (all the review sentences relevant to this attitude root)  
```

The top level also has the folder ```canonical_rebuttals_and_descs```. This contains the following files.  
```python
├── all_canonical_rebuttals_scores.tsv (contains all the canonical rebuttals with scores)  
├── all_canonical_rebuttals.tsv (contains only the canonical rebuttals)
├── all_cluster_descs.tsv (contains all the cluster descs)
```

### Codes 🧑‍💻
